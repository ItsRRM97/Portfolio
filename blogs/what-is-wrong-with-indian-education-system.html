										<h1>What is wrong with the Indian Education System?</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="../images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I am talking about the character here, where Rancho labeled this person as a “gadha” because first, he did engineering, then MBA in the US and then ended up doing a job in a Bank.
										Students in India pursue engineering in most of the colleges is simply because they want a job, not because they want a job in the field of Engineering. Just to get a job parents send their students from class 6 to IIT-JEE coaching and tuition. Here in India, people take up engineering to just get a certificate as a proof that they are ‘educated.’ Not everybody loves engineering, almost everybody hates engineering.			
										Today we have engineers in who write books and judge dance shows, we have engineers who do jobs in banks, and in fields not at all related to engineering. This has degraded engineering education in our country to such an extent that getting a job has become harder. Indian engineers are considered ‘unfit’ and ‘unemployable’ (see the numbers).
										</p>
									<p>I am currently in my second year of engineering and I randomly ask people what they want to be when they grow up. I still got answers like getting a job, do an MBA, do business and 2–3 out of my class of 60 actually wanted to code (in my branch) and they loved what they are doing. With this number of people in a classroom, lets multiply the ratio to the total number of students pursuing engineering education in India. Numbers never lie, right?
										I was passionate about computers and wanted to pursue a career in it. So I sat with over a million of candidates to appear what they call, the toughest competitive exam in the world. Didn’t make it.
										Why didn't I make it? I didn’t understand or (still understand) who do I need to study Physics, Chemistry so hard to study Computer Science Engineering in an IIT. And, people who love Physics, Chemistry end up doing engineering in CSE and do not know a shit about coding. To make things worse our reservation system makes sure people who love neither engineering or science make into these premium institutions of the country without much effort.
										</p>
									<p>What is wrong with Indian Education System? It makes SURE right people go to the wrong place, and wrong people go to the right place. * Slow Claps *</p>
										<p>Edit 1: To the people in comments who think JEE is fair I have a question for you to answer.										
										A person X who is really good in academics breeze through JEE and gets a seat in IIT appearing subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. He can’t write a single line of code. What branch? Computer Science Engineering.									
										Now person Y who is not so good in academics, but knew 5 programming languages and stuffs even before getting into Engineering, brews code all the time but sucks in Physics. Chemistry and Mathematics fail in JEE miserably.								
										Who deserves to study CSE at a prestigious engineering college? Doesn’t person Y deserve subsidy in his higher education? I belong to the Y category.									
										I am pursuing IT at a private college with an education loan of about 7.7 lakh p.a. Life is fair to me. Really.</p>
										
										<p>Edit 2:
										Arguments in the comments make my answer even better.
										For those who mention the names of Raghuram Rajan, Chetan Bhagat and other great people and question if they are “gadhas” or not. I am not eligible enough to comment on that. They are people who are very successful in their life but their engineering degree does not fit in all their achievements.										
										If Chetan Bhagat really wanted to be a writer and Raghuram Rajan really wanted to be a Economist, our education system in 11th and 12th should have rather focused on testing the aptitude of these people in the areas of interest/skills instead of putting an ant, an elephant and a monkey in the same test to climb a tree (you know what I mean). If this hadn’t happened such eminent personalities would have saved 4 years of their life doing what they love. Four years is a lot, a government tenure is just a year more than that.										
										No please, if someone is able to ace the IIT-JEE examinations and make it to the CSE branch at an IIT he cannot be a better professional programmer that someone who loves writing programs and has been doing that much earlier than him - Never; especially when MNCs prefer hiring people with experience and not freshers. Don’t ask me for numbers, verify yourself.										
										Whatever great names we hear today are people who love what they do. Barely any of them are IITians. Please, no more arguments.</p>
